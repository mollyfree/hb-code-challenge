Write a function that is a number guessing game. 

  So the whole thing is a function.

It should determine a random number from 1-100, 

  Code for choosing a random number. Assign that number to a variable (that won't change for a single user).

and let the user guess the number. 

  Prompt the user to guess a number.

It should report back whether their guess is correct, too high, or too low. 

  Report back using returns? puts?

Important: if the user guesses a number they've already guessed, it should tell them they have previously guessed this number. 

  create a function (or proc? or method?) that keeps track of their guesses in an array, and checks whether there are duplicates.

Until they guess the correct number, it should continue to prompt them. 

  function should have an "until" clause

Once they've guessed the correct number, it should congratulate them and tell them how many guesses they took to solve the problem (minus any duplicate guesses).

  returns a sentence, and tells them the length of the array above
